## Phase 3 Improvements
Phase 3 saw many changes in the develpoment of feature-hunt. In this document we provide a detailed overview of all the changes implemented by our team during Phase 3.

## Front End
The team worked meticulously to improve the user interface. While revamping the existing UI, we took the liberty to add a couple more features:
- The Phase 2 version did not have a login page
- The Phase 2 version did not have a signup page. 

*Improvements:*
1) Created a SignUp page to enable new users to create an account to use feature-hunt.
2) Designed a login page that acts as the portal to sign in once a user has an account (ONLY when a user has an account).
3) Added Collaborators to the project form. This helps us send email notifications to the collaborators regarding updates related to their project features.
4) Improved existing UI for displaying projects and features. 
5) Made the user experience more insightful by creating a description feature for each project and feature. A new user can intuitively understand what each project or feature does. 
6) Fixed the Search Bar functionality. Users can now use the search bar to look up Projects easily.

## Back End
With respect to backend, we decided to use the existing tech stack and improve upon it. We went ahead with using Docker and MongoDB as the previous team had done.

*Improvements:*
1) Redesigned the schema for feature-hunt
2) We introduced an email alerting mechanism that notified users with triggered email alerts. The notification is triggered upon the completion of a project close discussion date and informs the user about the five most popular features. There is also an attachment providing more information on all the features discussed as well.

## Tools used
The original team used React, JavaScript, Python3, Flask, MongoDB, HTML and CSS. In addition to these, we have used Bootstrap.

## Conclusion of Phase 3
Working on Phase 3 was an eye-opening simulation of how Software Engineering project development occurs in the real world. Countless brainstorming sessions to whip up a myriad of creative ideas which we brought to fruition, in short, the Phase 3 sojourn was a memorable learning experience. We would like to thank Dr. Timothy Menzies for helping us understand the process of building a good Software Engineering project. We would also like to thank the teaching assistants Xiao Ling, Andre Lustosa, Kewen Peng, Weichen Shi for their support throughout the project. We are grateful for the opportunity to work with our friends and colleagues at NCSU - shout out to the developers of Phase 1 and Phase 2 for their contribution to this amazing project!
